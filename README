An example of using the Boxcar API (via the Growl service, for redirections).

### For the Ruby example:

1) Install the 'httparty' gem if you don't already have it.  (gem install httparty).
2) Replace 'XXXREPLACE@MEXXX' with your username, and 'XXX' with your password on line 5.
3) Adjust the notification parameters.

The API itself uses HTTP BASIC authorization with your Boxcar e-mail address and password.  The URL is https://boxcar.io/notifications.  The parameters available to be passed in are:

* notification[from_screen_name] - This sets who or what application the notification is from.
* notification[message] - The notification message body.  This may be up to 140 characters, and will be trimmed if longer.
* notification[from_remote_service_id] - Optional.  Pass in a unique integer to guarantee that a duplicate notification will not be delivered.


### For the PHP (class.boxcar.php) example:

### For the REALBasic (REALBasic2010_deliver_notification.rbp) example:

By Sascha Schneppmueller, see http://help.boxcar.io/discussions/problems/334-boxcar-growl-plugin-for-windows for additional help.

Requires the CURLS plugin by Monkeybread Software.

Many, many thanks to gpetit and Sascha Schneppmueller.  Without your contributions we would not have a PHP or REALBasic plugin.
